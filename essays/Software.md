From a young age, I have always enjoyed building things and figuring out how they work. In seventh grade, I even started my own slime business where I spent hours experimenting with recipes until I found the right texture and colors. I then sold them to classmates after learning about pricing. My small slime business was not just about the slime, it was about the thrill of building something from scratch and seeing other people enjoy what I made. That same curiosity and enjoyment is present in other parts of my life, whether it was building with Legos or teaching myself new languages or even tutoring kids. Over time, I realized that software engineering was the perfect way to bring all of these interests together.

What draws me to software engineering is the mix of creativity and problem-solving. Learning programming languages sometimes feels like learning a spoken language. It can be confusing at first, but exhilarating when everything finally clicks. Writing code gives me the same satisfaction as solving a puzzle. At the same time, it can be frustrating, and I have learned that persistence and consistency is just as important as technical skill. 

As I move forward, I hope to understand my code on a deeper level. In the past, I have sometimes felt like I was just following steps to get something to run or to just get my assignments done, but I want to reach a point where I truly grasp why it works the way it does. My goal is to design programs that are not only functional but also efficient and well-structured. I want to be able to look at a project and easily see how the pieces connect and how it can be improved.

In the future, I see myself applying these skills in financial technology. I am drawn to fintech because it combines two things Iâ€™m studying: finance and computer science. I hope to work at a start-up, where I can be part of a team that builds something from the ground up, just like I did with slime jars back in middle school and just like I am doing when I tutor kids now, only on a much bigger scale.
