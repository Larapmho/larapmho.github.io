Before this class, Typescript was uncharted territory for me, and even though it has only been a few weeks working with this language, I like TypeScript so far. It is a language I find is very easy to approach. Since it is similar to Java, it feels somewhat familiar, which makes the learning curve less steep. At the same time, whilst learning TypeScript, I realized that I still needed to refresh and improve on my Java skills, which I started working on over the summer through the pre-game modules, so the similarities are both helpful and motivating. One of the assignments I particularly enjoyed was the ES6 module. The explanations about TypeScript were very clear and then reinforced with practice problems, which really helped cement the concepts for me. I also noticed that functions and other parts of the language seem more descriptive in TypeScript, making it easier for me to understand what the code is doing. Even with this, I know Iâ€™ll need more practice to feel confident and truly master the material.

Based on what I have been reading online, in a software engineering perspective, TypeScript seems to be a good language overall. It seems to add a level of clarity that makes it easier to debug code and prevents mistakes from slipping through. That is something I appreciate, since finding bugs early can save so much time and stress in the long run. Another strength is that TypeScript provides better context for others who may be reading your code. This is especially important when multiple people are working together on the same project. I can see why software engineers would prefer TypeScript in a team to collaborate more effectively by making the code more readable and predictable.

Athletic software engineering, however, has felt much more intimidating to me. When I first read the syllabus and modules describing the approach, I was quite concerned about how I would succeed in this type of environment. I do not usually perform well with timed work because I tend to focus more on the countdown than the actual task in front of me. Even if I have practiced, my anxiety tends to spike when the timer starts, leaving me with a blank mind full of random information. I also prefer to carefully think through a problem before I begin writing code, and the timed format does not give much room for that. On top of this, the grading system feels intense because there is no partial credit, which definitely raises the stakes and adds to the pressure.

That being said, I do see the value in the practice WODs and the athletic software engineering concept overall. I am a strong believer that practice makes perfect, and I like to use practice problems as a way to really understand new material. Working step by step helps me connect concepts and apply them more naturally when I am writing code. While the actual timed WODs still feel stressful, I can already tell that the practice is making me more comfortable with the process. My goal this semester is to be consistent in my practices, to not only improve my technical skills but also gain more confidence in timed situations, which could make me less anxious over time. In this sense, even though athletic software engineering feels challenging now, I can see how it could help me grow as both a student and a future software engineer.
